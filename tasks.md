# Current tasks
1) Initialization -- What are the constants that we need in order to communicate with our robot?  What initialization do the motors require (remember there are two types of motors in each swerve drive unit)?

2) Commands -- What commands do we need to control each of the swerve drive motors and what information do we need that is specific to each motor type?

3) Subsystem -- What do we need to do to control each swerve drive as a unit and what do we need to do to control all four of the swerve drives as a Drive Train Subsystem?

4) Controller -- Read and config the controller (PS4) to allow it to communicate with the robot.
